		<p><b>Name:</b> Rahat. <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motijheel_Government_Boys%27_High_School"><strong><i>#Centralian</i></strong></a>. Although it is not a big identity. Still, it feels good to put centralian at the end of the name. Anyway, at the time of opening the website, I was in 10th class of Motijheel Government Boys High School. Everyone has a special talent. He became excellent at that particular subject. That is his "super power". In my case maybe itâ€™s different. Nothing is finished properly by me. Everything is a failure to me. The end result of whatever I start is emptiness and some light frustration. Maybe this is my "super power" !!!<br>I've tried a lot of new things to find out what I like. Writing is a part of it. My writing may contain many grammatical or typographical mistakes. If you find any such mistake, forgive in your own knowledge.</p>
